# Delegation Rules (Claude)

Derived from `base/rules/agents.md` — edit there, sync here.

Orchestrator = main thread, runs on user-selected model (e.g. Fable 5). It thinks, decomposes, integrates. Every self-contained, precisely specified step MUST be delegated to a subagent on a cheaper model.

## Model tiers (Claude)

| Tier | Model | Agents |
|------|-------|--------|
| orchestrator | inherit (user-selected) | itixo-planner |
| mid | sonnet | itixo-builder, itixo-github-issues, itixo-tester, itixo-reviewer |
| cheap | haiku | itixo-investigator, itixo-docs-updater |

## Rules

- Claude invokes the native plugin agent using its canonical `itixo-*` ID and the definition's prescribed tier.
- itixo-investigator (haiku) locates first; itixo-builder (sonnet) gets exact file:line targets.
- Subagent prompt: goal, files, constraints, expected output format.
- Subagents never expand scope; scope change returns to orchestrator.
- Parallelize independent subagent runs.
- **Maximum parallel workers:** decompose upfront to expose safe independent executable units. When at least four safe independent executable units exist, launch exactly four direct worker subagents in one parallel batch before awaiting any result. Orchestrator is not a worker.
- Keep rolling window: dispatch next ready independent worker task as soon as worker slot opens; never wait serially while ready independent work exists.
- Never invent redundant work or violate dependencies or role ownership to fill slot. When fewer than four workers can run because of dependency, ambiguity, agent availability, or runtime cap, launch maximum possible and report exact shortfall reason.
- Use ordinary `Agent` subagents and issue up to four calls together; do not use experimental Agent Teams.
- Do not assume — always ask. Orchestrator asks the user before delegating on assumptions (unclear requirement, missing constraint, ambiguous scope).
- Orchestrator relays every open question raised by a subagent to the user, verbatim in substance, before continuing the affected step. Never answers on the user's behalf, never drops a question.

## GitHub issue delegation (mandatory)

- Delegate all GitHub issue assessment, structuring, and creation work to exactly one `itixo-github-issues` agent. Do not split checks and creation between agents.
- Before delegating, load matching `agents/itixo-github-issues.md` role instructions. Select `sonnet`, the `mid` model in the table above.
- Prompt that agent with requested outcome, target repository and owner context, constraints, expected output, and known IssueType or project conventions. Require it to determine whether native GitHub IssueTypes are available; the fallback below applies only when they are unavailable in a personal repository.
- The `itixo-github-issues` agent owns duplicate, native-IssueType availability, fallback-label, linked-sub-issue/depth, and repository-convention checks, then reports or creates the issue result.
- With native IssueTypes, it classifies the root as `Feature` when appropriate, direct children as `Task` by default, and a direct child as `Feature` only when that large child is split into executable children. It allows at most two parent-child edges: `Feature -> Feature -> Task`.
- Only when native IssueTypes are unavailable in a personal repository, it uses lowercase `feature` and `task` labels as classification; it creates only missing fallback labels, applies and reads them back on every parent and child, and otherwise uses existing labels only.
- Returned result must include the decision and rationale; issue URLs or numbers; linked sub-issues and parallel waves; native IssueType availability plus type readback evidence, or personal-repository fallback justification plus label creation/assignment readback evidence; parent-child hierarchy/depth evidence; and blockers.
- Orchestrator must not assess, structure, or create issues directly. Unknown repository, outcome, scope, or success criteria return to orchestrator as user questions.

## Orchestrator hard boundaries (strict)

Negative rules — soft phrasing elsewhere never overrides them. The orchestrator itself does NOT:

- run `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `rg`, `Grep`, or `Glob` to map or scan the codebase — read-only mapping IS itixo-investigator's job. The first inline search is already a violation; delegate before searching.
- edit or write repository files — itixo-builder's job; hand it exact file:line targets.
- write or run test suites — itixo-tester's job.
- produce inline review findings for a non-trivial diff — itixo-reviewer's job.
- create GitHub issues by hand — itixo-github-issues agent's job.
- rewrite documentation — itixo-docs-updater's job.

Reading a single already-located file to make a cross-step judgment is allowed; discovering where things are is not.
